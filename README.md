# Students Collaboration Practice

This repository is created for **Advanced Programming (AP)** students to practice working with GitHub, Forks, Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests.

## How to participate
1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new branch named `feature/<your-name>`.
4. Inside the `students/` folder, create a new directory with your student ID.
5. Add:
   - A text file (`info.txt`) containing your name and your student ID.  
   - A simple script in Java which prints a string (like `Hello World!`).
6. Commit your changes with meaningful messages (do not commit all changes at once).
7. Push your branch to your fork.
8. Open a Pull Request to the main repository.

## Rules
- Do not change files outside your own folder.
- Use meaningful commit messages.  
- Always create a branch (do not work directly on `main`).

## Goal
By completing this exercise, you will gain practical experience with the GitHub workflow commonly used in open-source projects.
